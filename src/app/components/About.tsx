      <p>
        Over the last few years I&apos;ve been the guy that you could always go
        to in order to get things done. I&apos;ve prided myself on being able to
        approach problems from a unique perspective. My varied background allows
        me to approach building complex applications, or microservices within a
        large ecosystem.

      <p>
        As part of the FinTech team at Pluralsight I worked on the quote-to-cash
        motions. This involved over 40 separate microservice and frontend
        applications to orchestrate the checkout processes. Part of my role was
        to help organize work and mentor other developers. This role also
        allowed me to take part in one of the largest b2b transformations of its
        kind, completely revamping the b2b processes end to end, leading to
        increased sales efficiency.

      <p>
        I like to build cool things. I take great pride in focusing on fine
        details and building out clean, maintainable solutions.
