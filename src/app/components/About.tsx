      <h3>Personal</h3>
      <p>
        In my personal life I love learning and building. I&apos;ve been known to
        woodwork and tinker with computer hardware. At one point I was regularly
        participating in PC speed building competitions, my fastest time at 8
        min 45sec{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        These days I spend the majority of my time enjoying hikes around where I
        live, and traveling as much as I can.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love photography and I love seeking out the lesser known parts of
        cities or places I&apos;ve never been before. I&apos;d rather find a hole in the
        wall restaurant loved by the locals than visit a chain. Sometimes this
        involves not knowing the language and trying my best. Sometimes it works
        out, sometimes it doesn&apos;t{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I love food, I love seeking new experiences, and I love building things.
        There is nothing better than learning something new.
      </p>
      <h3>Work</h3>
      <p>
        Over the last few years I&apos;ve been the guy that you could always go
        to in order to get things done. I&apos;ve prided myself on being able to
        approach problems from a unique perspective. My varied background allows
        me to approach building complex applications, or microservices within a
        large ecosystem, all while breaking that complexity down for non
        technical stakeholders.
      </p>

      <p>
        As part of the FinTech team at Pluralsight I worked on the quote-to-cash
        motions. This involved over 40 separate microservice and frontend
        applications to orchestrate the checkout processes. Part of my role was
        to help organize work and mentor other developers. This role also
        allowed me to take part in one of the largest B2B transformations of its
        kind, completely revamping the B2B processes end to end, leading to
        increased sales efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ranging from checkout, to subscription management, to product internal
        apps, and payment processing and provisioning for hundreds of thousands
        of customers I worked on a wonderful team of passionate, fleet footed
        developers. As the business evolved we worked to keep up with the
        various changes that ended up being the largest digital transformation
        of it&apos;s kind. Completely revamping all B2B sales motions over the course
        of a year and a half.
      </p>

      <p>
        I like to build cool things. I take great pride in focusing on fine
        details and building out clean, maintainable solutions.
